<!-- STATUS:
DRAFT 22/8/7: Found material interesting:

Maxwell's -> Fourier optics (scalar wave phenomena) -> Eikonal equation (rays, but in inhomogeneous media) -> Ray optics (rays, but in almost-everywhere homogeneous media).

I think most modern optics textbooks (see, e.g., Fundamentals of Photonics) cover the reductions and the corresponding steps.
